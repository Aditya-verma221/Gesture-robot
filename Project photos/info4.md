In the photos you can see me using 5v 2amp dc power adapter to power the Robot because
with 9v batteries my 150 rpm bo motors were running too fast due to which synchronization between reciever & transmitter was poor.
So, I used the 5v supply to make it work though I'll recommend using 60rpm BOs for a smooth working.
